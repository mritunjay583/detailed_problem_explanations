1.  A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U.

2.  A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color

3.  it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using two colors.
4.  It is not possible to color a cycle graph with odd cycle using two colors. so, **Bipartite graph has no odd cycle**

5.  graph with no edges is also Bipartite
6.  Bipartite condition says all edges should be from one set to another.
    means edges of edges must have different colour
        A-------------------------B
        colour(A)!=colour(B)
        Note : - In bipartatie graph has only two colour
